# Casino 

Casino is a **web-based application** that simulates three popular casino games: **Slots, Blackjack, and Roulette**. It supports both **single-player** and **multiplayer** over Wi-Fi, with all bets placed using **virtual currency (VC)**.

Unlike real online casinos, this project is **free, open source, and for educational/entertainment purposes only** â€” no real money, no accounts, no ads.
